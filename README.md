1. Examples of CNF encoding
Given two numbers, implement a conversion program to CNF sugguested form for addition, and confirm it result by SAT solvers (e.g., miniSAT).

2. Examples of CNF encoding
Given two numbers, implement a conversion program to CNF sugguested form for multiplication, and confirm it result by SAT solvers (e.g., miniSAT).

4. Examples of CNF encoding 
Implement Tseitin conversion.

5. Examples of CNF encoding
Implement SUDOKU solver (using SAT solver, like miniSAT.)

6. Examples of CNF encoding
Solve the puzzle by implementing a puzzle solver using miniSAT.
(Rule of puzzle: the number in a box is the number of black boxes among adjacent to it or itself.)

9. Cut elimination, decidability, completeness of LK of propositional logic
Given a sequent Γ → ∆. Implement a decision procedure that finds a
proof of Γ → ∆ if exists. (If not, return “unprovable”.)
